# Blackjack Card Counter
A simple but very useful blackjack card counter program which can be used to gain a small edge over a casino if used correctly with basic strategy. If you do not know basic strategy, then you can easily find a chart online according to the rules of the version of blackjack you are playing.

Features:
- Calculates the running count and true count using Hi-Lo system.
- Tells you the betting deviations using 1-8 bet spread.
- Tells you the playing deviations using Illustrious 18 (assumes the dealer stands on soft 17).

How to use:
- Enter the number of decks that are in the shoe (typically 8 decks).
- Enter the cards as they come out of the shoe.
- When the shoe is changed, press the reset button.

Reminders:
- Only start playing & counting with a new shoe even if you have to wait a long time for the current shoe to be switched.
- Count every card that comes out of the new shoe.
- Place the correct bet amount every round as suggested by the program. For example, if your 1 unit = $10, 2 units = $20, 4 units = $40, etc.
- Make the correct decisions, play according to basic strategy if you do not need to deviate.
